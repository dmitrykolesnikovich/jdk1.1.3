/**
 * <code>Calendar</code> is an abstract base class for converting between
 * a <code>Date</code> object and a set of integer fields such as
 * <code>YEAR</code>, <code>MONTH</code>, <code>DAY</code>, <code>HOUR</code>,
 * and so on. (A <code>Date</code> object represents a specific instant in
 * time with millisecond precision. See
 * <a href="java.util.Date.html"><code>java.util.Date</code></a>
 * for information about the <code>Date</code> class.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Subclasses of <code>Calendar</code> interpret a <code>Date</code>
 * according to the rules of a specific calendar system. The JDK
 * provides one concrete subclass of <code>Calendar</code>:
 * <code>GregorianCalendar</code>. Future subclasses could represent
 * the various types of lunar calendars in use in many parts of the world.
 *
 * <p>
 * Like other locale-sensitive classes, <code>Calendar</code> provides a
 * class method, <code>getInstance</code>, for getting a generally useful
 * object of this type. <code>Calendar</code>'s <code>getInstance</code> method
 * returns a <code>GregorianCalendar</code> object whose
 * time fields have been initialized with the current date and time:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance();
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>Calendar</code> object can produce all the time field values
 * needed to implement the date-time formatting for a particular language
 * and calendar style (for example, Japanese-Gregorian, Japanese-Traditional).
 *
 * <p>
 * When computing a <code>Date</code> from time fields, two special circumstances
 * may arise: there may be insufficient information to compute the
 * <code>Date</code> (such as only year and month but no day in the month),
 * or there may be inconsistent information (such as "Tuesday, July 15, 1996"
 * -- July 15, 1996 is actually a Monday).
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Insufficient information.</strong> The calendar will use default
 * information to specify the missing fields. This may vary by calendar; for
 * the Gregorian calendar, the default for a field is the same as that of the
 * start of the epoch: i.e., YEAR = 1970, MONTH = JANUARY, DATE = 1, etc.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Inconsistent information.</strong> The calendar will give preference
 * to the combinations of fields in the following order (and disregard other
 * inconsistent information).
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * month + day-of-month
 * month + week-of-month + day-of-week
 * month + day-of-week-of-month + day-of-week
 * day-of-year
 * day-of-week + week-of-year
 * hour-of-day
 * ampm + hour-of-ampm
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> for some non-Gregorian calendars, different
 * fields may be necessary for complete disambiguation. For example, a full
 * specification of the historial Arabic astronomical calendar requires year,
 * month, day-of-month <em>and</em> day-of-week in some cases.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> There are certain possible ambiguities in
 * interpretation of certain singular times, which are resolved in the
 * following ways:
 * <ol>
 *     <li> 24:00:00 "belongs" to the following day. That is,
 *          23:59 on Dec 31, 1969 &lt; 24:00 on Jan 1, 1970 &lt; 24:01:00 on Jan 1, 1970
 *
 *     <li> Although historically not precise, midnight also belongs to "am",
 *          and noon belongs to "pm", so on the same day,
 *          12:00 am (midnight) &lt; 12:01 am, and 12:00 pm (noon) &lt; 12:01 pm
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * The date or time format strings are not part of the definition of a
 * calendar, as those must be modifiable or overridable by the user at
 * runtime. Use <a href="java.text.DateFormat.html">java.text.DateFormat</a>
 * to format dates.
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>Calendar</code> provides an API for field "rolling", where fields
 * can be incremented or decremented, but wrap around. For example, rolling the
 * month up in the date "September 12, 1996" results in "October 12, 1996".
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>Calendar</code> also provides a date arithmetic function for
 * adding the specified (signed) amount of time to a particular time field.
 * For example, subtracting 5 days from the date "September 12, 1996" results
 * in "September 7, 1996".
